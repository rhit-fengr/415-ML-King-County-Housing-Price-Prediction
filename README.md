# 415-ML-King-County-Housing-Price-Prediction
For demo purposes, please look into Kings_County_Housing_Price_Cleaned.ipynb. <br />
It should be just one click on "Run All" to go through all cells. <br />
Note that it took ~1 hour for Random Forest training, and ~4 hours for Gradient Boosting Trees - if you don't want that, please comment them out. <br />
SBR part was mostly commented out for giving R2 socre of 0. They are not deleted though, if you want to experiment on it. <br />
<br />
Thanks for your support! <br />
